Once packed, boxes head down another belt beneath a labeling machine that prints and sticks mailing labels in one swoop. Now sealed and stamped, orders are shunted down their final chutes to await loading onto trucks, a Tetris-like task that involves packing the boxes as tight and straight as possible for delivery to UPS, FedEx, and other shippers. An employee manually fits hundreds of packages into the back of a truck in one of the outgoing bays. From here, the packages go on to be delivered by one of many different shipment companies.

Amazon is facing a federal investigation into the death of a worker at a Pennsylvania fulfillment center who was reportedly struck and pinned by a pallet jack she was operating. Much has also been written about how the unrelenting nature of Amazon\'s fulfillment system can foster exploitive, sometimes hazardous working conditions that have become the target of at least one set of class-action lawsuits. At PHX6, the climate was temperate, all the more remarkable considering the blazing Arizona sun outside. Natural light streamed from skylights, though the walls were windowless. Water seemed readily available. But like any assembly line, the point of Amazon\'s fulfillment system isn\'t comfort or creativity but precision–a Taylorist approximation of machine-like behavior by people. Even the one seeming signifier of tech-company whimsy is purely practical: the giant tricycles have baskets where maintenance workers could put their tools while they traversed a space the size of 28 football fields from one job to the next. The point of Amazon\'s fulfillment system isn\'t human comfort or creativity but precision–a Taylorist approximation of machine-like behavior by people. In a way, an Amazon fulfillment center is like a giant robot, and the way to streamline it would be to roboticize as much of the work as possible. Amazon is slowly working to incorporate more robots into its warehouses, but human hands and brains are still the best tools for many jobs. Ultimately, the company has the algorithmic intelligence to determine what balance of robots and people to strike to keep its global machine moving at peak efficiency. This intelligence is also what gives Amazon maximum advantage over its major retail rivals, none of which were founded as tech companies first. At the same time, no other tech rival–not Google, Apple, Facebook, or Microsoft–can touch Amazon\'s physical logistical advantage in retail, and none will anytime soon. Unlike software, fulfillment centers aren\'t built overnight. "That stuff is hard to replicate, and it\'s really hard to short-circuit as well," Wingo says, adding that he doubts Alibaba will be able simply to enter the U.S. market and readily replicate Amazon\'s infrastructure, contrary to speculation ahead of the Chinese e-commerce giant\'s IPO. \"There are certain things in the world that you can\'t just hack and reverse-engineer quickly.\" For now, that on-the-ground superiority means Amazon is defining the 21st-century consumer experience. That power will keep other sellers flocking to cast their goods into Amazon\'s flow, like sticks tossed into a rushing river. And everything about Amazon seems angled toward breaking through the logistical barriers holding that river back. Amazon\'s warehouses are designed to be wish-fulfillment machines, calibrated to feed our consumer wants with aggressive speed and precision at a scale that has yet to find its limit.
